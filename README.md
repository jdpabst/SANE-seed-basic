### Code setup

3. Create a 'config.js' file in the server folder (It is already ignored).

#### should look something like this. (Update for your use)
```javascript
var port = 3000; // Feel free to change the port number
module.exports = {
 PORT: port,
 MASSIVE_URI: 'postgres://localhost/testingdb',
 SESSION_SECRET: 'secret',
 INITALIZE_LOG: true,
 AUTH_CONFIG: {
		domain: 'Auth0 domain (Found in Auth0 setup step 5)',
		clientID: 'Auth0 clientId (Found in Auth0 setup step 5)',
		clientSecret: 'Auth0 clientSecret (Found in Auth0 setup step 5)',
		callbackURL: 'http://localhost:' + port + '/auth/callback'
	}
};
```

1. Go to auth0.com and log in / sign up.
2. On the Dashboard, click the new client button in the top right corner.
3. Give your app a name and select the 'Single Page Web App' client type.
4. On your client page, click the settings tab.
5. Here you will find all the info you will need to finish your 'config.js'.
6. Scroll down and add 'http://localhost:PORT/auth/callback' (Where 'PORT' is the  port number from your config) to your 'Allowed Callback URLs' input box (make sure to save when your done)
7. If you want to use facebook, go to social connections and on the attributes section of the facebook connection, enable email. (or if you want to do this for any other connection as well, an email is required. if there is no email, it wont work). Otherwise, disable facebook.
